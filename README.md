# Mindvalley Onboarding V2 - RADICAL REDESIGN
## Based on Growth Design Principles

**Created:** January 14, 2026
**Goal:** 2x conversion improvement through experience-first approach
**Time to Value:** 60 seconds (vs 5+ minutes in V1)

---

## 🎯 THE BIG IDEA

**Show, don't tell. Let them EXPERIENCE value before asking for payment.**

Growth Design case studies (Duolingo, Calm, Headspace, Netflix) all follow the same pattern:
1. Quick, visual onboarding
2. **Immediate value delivery** (experience the product)
3. Paywall AFTER they're hooked
4. Free trial to remove friction

---

## 🔥 WHAT CHANGED (V1 → V2)

### Removed:
- ❌ **Eve text-heavy intro** (7 screens of reading)
- ❌ **Payment upfront** (major friction)
- ❌ **14-screen flow** (too long)
- ❌ **No proof of value** before paywall

### Added:
- ✅ **Visual quiz** (30 seconds, not 5 minutes)
- ✅ **Testimonials IN the quiz** (build trust while collecting data)
- ✅ **Quick win experience** (5-min meditation BEFORE paywall)
- ✅ **7-day free trial** (removes payment friction)
- ✅ **Emotional paywall** (continue vs start)
- ✅ **10-screen flow** (40% shorter)
